# Faiz Khairi

**Full-Stack Software Engineer** based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

I build scalable web and mobile applications — from frontend UI to backend systems, enterprise integrations, and cloud infrastructure.

- **Workflow engine** — Created a visual BPMN process and form builder with drag-and-drop design, conditional logic, and multi-step workflow automation
- **DevOps infrastructure** — Architected multi-environment CI/CD pipelines (DEV/STG/PRD) on AWS with Docker containerization, automated deployments, and Nginx reverse proxy across 8 services
